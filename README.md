## TODO

search:
- filenames should change color when its matched (match should be red) -- matches should also reutrn the indexes of the matches of the characters on success, and matches should be reduce()-ed into 3 lists (full tag matches, the whole search matches in a row, and it fuzzy matches) then concatted in that priority
- tags should appear as symbols (replacing the symbol that's there), https://www.npmjs.com/package/yaml-front-matter, also convert all tags to front-matter

render:
- links shouldn't go off screen
- code blocks should scroll


## INSTRUCTIONS:

```bash
cd view
npm i
cd ../backend
npm i
npm run start
```
