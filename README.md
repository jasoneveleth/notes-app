TODO:
- need to actually filter the as i search
- maybe put the back to render button where plus button is so its easy to switch back and forth (if you need to reference something when you're writing)
- git add, commit, push (node exec Sync -- different from spawn sync)

INSTRUCTIONS:
```bash
cd view
npm i
cd ../backend
npm i
npm run start
```
